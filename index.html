                    I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Economics at Brown University. I will be on the job market in 2020-2021 and attend the ASSA Meetings and EEA Meetings
                    <br /><br />
                    My research focuses on public and labor economics, with a focus on intergenerational mobility.
                   In my job market paper I study how economic shocks to parents affect the educational outcomes of children.

                    Parent layoffs and children’s careers

                    Abstract: <br />
                    We analyse the effect of a parent's layoff on the educational outcomes of their children.
                     We use administrative data on layoffs caused by shocks to labor demand and variation in child age at the time a parent is laid off to estimate the 
                     age-specific impact on high school graduation rates. 
                     We find that parent layoff may have a large impact on high school completion rates, 
                     but the effect is restricted to children who are about to apply to high school. 
                     A parent layoff in the month before the school choice deadline decreases the likelihood that the child will finish high school on time by 
                     9 percentage points relative to a layoff in the same school semester, but after the deadline. The effect is higher for low-information families, 
                     consistent with the hypothesis that making optimal education decisions may be costly, even if there are no financial constraints on access to education.

                We observe a decrease in likelihood of graduating high school on time (at age 19) for children whose parents are laid off right before they transition
                 from compulsory school to high school, at age 16. 
                 Families with parent layoffs are matched to survivor families with a non-zero risk of layoff

                Children who have already completed high school at the time of parent layoff serve as an additonal control group to account for any selection on unobservables. 
             A parental layoff at age 21 can not affect high school graduation at age 19.
