                Family-level stress and children's educational choice: Evidence from parent layoffs

We analyse the effect of a parent's layoff on the educational outcome of their children. We use administrative data on layoffs caused by shocks to labor demand and variation in child age at the time of parent layoff to estimate the age-specific impact on high school graduation rates. We find that parent layoff may have a large impact on high school completion rates, but the effect is concentrated to children who are about to apply to high school. A parent layoff in the month before the school choice deadline decreases the likelihood for the child to finish high school on time by 9 percentage points relative to a layoff in the same school semester, but after the deadline. The effect is higher for low-information families, consistent with the hypothesis that making the right choice may be costly, even if the final good is free.
